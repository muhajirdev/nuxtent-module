# Nuxtent

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/nuxt-community/nuxtent-module.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The goal of Nuxtent is to make using Nuxt for content heavy sites as easy as using Jekyll, Hugo, or any other static site generator.

It does in two main ways:

1. By compiling all the data from `markdown` or `yaml` files based on configured rules.
2. By providing helpers for dynamically accessing this data inside Nuxt pages.

But, we didn't just want to make Nuxtent as good as a static site generatorâ€“we wanted to make it better.

So, along with that, Nuxtent also supports:

3. The usage of content files in both static sites and dynamic applications.
4. The usage of `async components` inside markdown files.

There you go: four reasons to give `Nuxtent` a try, and maybe even star and [share]("https://twitter.com/intent/tweet) it. :smirk:

## Quick Start

If you're starting a new site, you can use the [nuxtent-starter](https://github.com/nuxt-community/content-template) template.

``` bash
$ vue init nuxt-community/nuxtent-template my-site
$ cd my-site
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install
```

## Installation

```
npm install nuxtent --save

```

Then, under `nuxt.config.js` install the module:

```
modules: [
   'nuxtent'
 ]
```
